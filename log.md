| 1863359   | First of the extra data generation (size 15), 10 parallel <br> processees running 1100 datapoints for p = 0.17...0.19 |
| 1863409   | Second of the extra data generation (size 21), 10 parallel <br> processees running 1100 datapoints for p = 0.17...0.19 |
| 1863459   | Third of the extra data generation (size 23), 10 parallel <br> processees running 1100 datapoints for p = 0.17...0.19 |
| 1863559   | Fourth of the extra data generation (size 25), 10 parallel <br> processees running 1100 datapoints for p = 0.17...0.19 |
| 1870440   | Comparasion with equal amount of steps for STDC and PTEQ, <br> L=11 for all p with 10000 datapoints (1e7 metropolis steps) |
| 1884584   | PTEQ run for L = 11 while saving the number of steps used <br> for each syndrom for later comparasion to STDC (all p)
| 1884938   | Same as above for L = 7
| 1890413   | STDC run corresponding to L=7 , steps PTEQ 25547 -> 89414 STDC
| 1890445   | STDC run corresponding to L=11, steps PTEQ 170013 -> 935071 STDC
